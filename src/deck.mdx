## Motivation

- What is Data Fetching?
- Why we need Data Fetching?
- Why is it hard?

---

## What is Data Fetching?

- It is the reading/retrieve of data from somewhere
- You can fetch data from local storage (disk) or network storage (server)

---

## Network Data Fetching Example

<Img src='./img/request.png' width={500} />

---

## Why we need Data Fetching?

- We can't keep all app data in memory
- We can't download all app user data locally
- We just want to fetch data we going to need

---

## Why is it hard?

- We don't want to overfetch (bring more data that we need)
- We don't want to underfetch (bring less data that we need)
---

## Why is it hard?

- We need to know from where we can get the data we need
- We can have more then one "endpoint" to get the data
- We want to cache data already fetched, so we don't waste network usage
---

## Imperative Data Fetching

- You define step by step how to do the data fetching logic
- You define the endpoints
- You define how to cache/store the data
- You define how to invalidate stale data
- You define when to do data fetching

---

## Imperative Data Fetching

<Img src='./img/getPosts.png' width={400} />

---

## Declarative Data Fetching

- You define the data which components needs
- Relay/Apollo makes sure the data is ready when rendering the components

---

## Declarative Data Fetching

<Img src='./img/declarative.png' width={500} />

---

## History/Evolution

- componentDidMount
- Redux Thunk
- Redux Saga
- useEffect hook
- Relay HOCs
- Suspense
- Relay hooks + Suspense

---

## ComponentDidMount

<Img src='./img/componentDidMount.png' width={500} />

---

## ComponentDidMount drawbacks
- class api
- data fetching logic spread on component lifecycles
- imperative api
- render then fetch (request waterfall)

---

## Request Waterfall

- You first fetch code (code split)
- then you fetch data

---

## Request Waterfall

<Img src='./img/requestWaterfall.png' width={1100} />

---

## Redux Thunk

<Img src='./img/reduxThunk.png' width={300} />

---

## Redux Thunk drawbacks
- imperative api
- hard to sync loading state with component

---

## Redux Saga

<Img src='./img/reduxSaga.png' width={500} />

---

## Redux Saga drawbacks
- same as Redux Thunk

---

## UseEffect

<Img src='./img/useEffect.png' width={400} />

---

## UseEffect drawbacks

- imperative api
- keep state of loading, error, isMounted, fetch cancelling
- hard to handle race conditions

---

## Data Fetching Race Conditions

<Img src='./img/search.png' width={900} />

---

## Why Data Fetching Race Conditions happens?

- network can be slow
- backend could be under heavy load
- user is typing too fast
- you are unlucky
- debounce is not enough

---

## How to "solve" Data Fetching Race Conditions

- ignore responses from former api calls
- cancel former api calls

---

## Relay HOCs

<Img src='./img/relayHoc.png' width={700} />

---

## Relay HOCs

- declarative data fetching
- data components

---

## Relay fragments understanding

<Img src='./img/dataRequirements.png' width={700} />

---

## Relay HOCs Drawbacks

- HOC API - more "components" in the tree
- render props API to handle loading and error state

---

## Suspense

- React suspense is a way to let components suspend while loading/fetching code or data

---

## Suspense

<Img src='./img/suspense.png' width={700} />

---

## Suspend on Code Loading

<Img src='./img/lazy.png' width={900} />

---

## Suspense for Data Fetching

<Img src='./img/simpleSuspense.png' width={600} />

---

## Suspense Resource

<Img src='./img/suspenseResource.png' width={300} />

---

### Suspense Resource Pseudo Algorithm

- Try to read entry from cache
- If request is pending, throw promise (react will suspend the component)
- If request is reject, throw error (error boundary will catch the error)
- When request promise is resolved react will render again your component
- Go back to first step

---

## Benefits of Suspense

- it only shows Loading indicator when loading/fetch is slow enough
- it "transforms" Async in Synchronous

---

## Fetch Policy

- fetch then render
- render then fetch

---

### What's Next?

- Stable React Suspense Concurrent Mode
- Stable Relay Modern Hooks
- Stable Scheduler APIs
